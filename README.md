# Bouncing_Balls
Created with CodeSandbox

Collision detection using X number of balls as input objects (can be scaled up or down based on input); Balls spawn at random location within the height and width constraints of the browser frame page; When a ball collides with another ball both balls involved change to a random color, and move in a direction based off real world velocity changes.
